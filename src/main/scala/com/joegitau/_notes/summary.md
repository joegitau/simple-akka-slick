## Advantages to using Akka actors as intermediaries between the Service layer and HTTP routes instead of using controllers:

1. Concurrency: Akka actors provide a highly concurrent model for processing requests. Each actor processes messages asynchronously, allowing for a high degree of parallelism. This can lead to improved performance and scalability compared to traditional controllers.
2. Fault tolerance: Akka actors provide a built-in mechanism for handling failures and errors. If an actor encounters an error, it can restart itself or delegate to another actor to handle the error. This can help improve the reliability and resilience of the application.
3. Message passing: Akka actors communicate with each other using message passing, which can help decouple the different components of the application. 
This can make the application more modular and easier to maintain.
4. State management: Akka actors can maintain state internally, which can simplify the implementation of complex business logic. This can help to reduce the amount of code in the Service layer and improve the overall organization of the application.


## Concurrency benefits. What is concurrency?
Concurrency refers to the ability of a computer system to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. 
In the context of web applications, concurrency is particularly important because multiple requests can be received by the server at the same time, 
and it's desirable to be able to process those requests in parallel in order to achieve better performance and throughput.
<br><br>

When it comes to implementing web applications in Scala, there are several ways to achieve concurrency. One common approach is to use threads, which allow multiple tasks to be executed in parallel. <br>
However, thread-based concurrency can be complex and error-prone, particularly when it comes to coordinating access to shared resources such as databases or caches.
<br><br>

An alternative approach is to use the actor model of concurrency, which is implemented in the Akka toolkit. <br>
In this model, actors are independent, isolated entities that communicate with each other by exchanging messages. Each actor has its own state and processing logic, and can process messages asynchronously without interfering with other actors.


__The actor model provides several benefits for concurrent web applications, including:__

1. Parallelism: By using actors to process requests, it's possible to achieve a high degree of parallelism without the need for complex thread management. Each actor can process requests independently, allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously.
2. Isolation: Because actors are isolated from each other, they can't interfere with each other's state or processing logic. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the application and to avoid race conditions and other concurrency-related bugs.
3. Fault tolerance: Because each actor is independent, failures in one actor won't affect the behavior of other actors. Additionally, Akka provides built-in mechanisms for handling errors and restarting actors automatically in case of failures.
4. Scalability: Because actors can be distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster, it's possible to achieve high levels of scalability and fault tolerance by adding more nodes to the cluster as needed.

Overall, the actor model provides a powerful and flexible approach to concurrency that is well-suited to web applications. 
By using Akka actors as intermediaries between the Service layer and HTTP routes, it's possible to achieve high levels of concurrency while still maintaining a modular and maintainable codebase.
